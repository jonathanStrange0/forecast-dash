This is a dash application meant to be a reimplementation of Matt Dancho's 2019 DataScience Go Shiny app in R.

The models used to forecast are for placement only, and have no backtesting or cross validation done on them at all.

This is meant to only be a showcase of what is possible with Dash, and how it differes from Shiny.


I hope you enjoy.

Cheers,

Jonathan Mucha.
